# C02-Emissions
Finding unequal production of carbon between countries. Analyzing relationships like Avg. Carbon footprint per Capita vs Avg. Median Household Income"
My conclusion was that there is a remakable disparity in carbon emissions (as measured by carbon footprint) between the wealthiest countries and the poorest countries. 


Found through this project  As seen in the plot below, a small number of wealthy countries contribute a significantly higher amount of carbon emissions: And even within the wealthiest countries, an even small number contribute disproportionately higher amounts of carbon. As seen in the figure below, the countires that produce the most carbon are also some of the wealthiest in the world. 
As median income increases so does carbon footprint (at an incredibly high rate). Only countries from the High Income and Upper Middle Income groups produce the the highest number of carbon emissions (as measured by carbon footprint).
